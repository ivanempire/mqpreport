\subsection{Abstract}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Project scope and 1-2 sentence summary
	\item Approach towards design and new type of reactor
	\item Method - how implementation was done with MCNP
	\item Summary of results
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Detailed project scope and goal
	\item Background research on reactors
	\item Showcase several existing designs
	\item Our own design and introduction to it
	\item Extremely brief overview of procedure - 1-2 sentences
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Materials}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A computer
	\item Obtaining MCNP
	\item Application process?
	\item Working locally
	\item Running a remote version
\end{itemize}
\subsection{MCNP}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Brief background on MCNP - how it came to be, what it is based on
	\item Applications of MCNP
	\item From above bullet - why we used it
	\item Structure of an MCNP program
	\item Basic shapes and geometry
	\item Run a tally as an example
	\item Code snippets throughout the way
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Method/Design}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Describe each component in turn:
	\item Core design and its materials
	\item Enclosing shell
	\item Neutron chamber
	\item Tally at the end
	\item All with calculations - specifically why tally at a certain distance
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Results}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Criticality runs and results (all of their configurations)
	\item Tally runs - final outputs
	\item Power calculations and comparisons with other research reactors (assuming it works)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Conclusion}
\subsection{Further work}
\subsection{Appendix}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Code snippets
\end{itemize}
