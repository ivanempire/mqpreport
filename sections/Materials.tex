\section*{Materials}
There were several key materials used throughout this project in order to make it happen. The main one being MCNP - Monte Carlo N-Particle code. This is a programming language based on FORTRAN-90 that we used for the reactor design and simulations. Permission to use it was granted by the RSICC lab - Radiation Safety Information Computational Center at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
