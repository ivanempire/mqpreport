Nuclear reactors are useful for more than just power - they are the practical neutron sources, but are held back by their large size and prohibitive cost. Neutron sources are essential for academic research, medical isotope generation, and allow for advanced imaging. This project attempts to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel reactor, designed for academic use. The safety features are inspired by Generation-IV reactor designs and thus is designed to be passively safe and proliferation resistant. The Geometrically Optimized Flux Reactor (GOFR) is a small device, approximately 8 cubic meters in volume, and has neutron flux that can exceed much larger reactors. This combination of size, safety, and beam flux makes GOFR ideal for a variety of applications and institutions.
