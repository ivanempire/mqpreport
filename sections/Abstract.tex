Although primarily used for power generation, nuclear reactors can serve other purposes as well. One of the more prominent uses is academic research. However, given the massive size, cost and general requirements for maintaining a full-scale nuclear reactor, almost no academic institutions have one. With the advent of Generation-IV standards for nuclear reactors, this projects attempts to prototype a reactor that may be used in academic settings. The Geometrically Optimized Flux Reactor (GOFR) is a small-scale device, approximately 1 cubic meter in volume. The chances of a core meltdown are slim due to its ability to self-regulate as the temperature increases. It is able to output a more powerful beam of neutrons than much larger devices. This combination of size, safety and output capability makes it ideal for research purposes.
