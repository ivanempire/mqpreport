\section*{Method}
The method that was used to design the reactor was anything but linear. After getting acquainted with MCNP, we started creating basic core and its shell geometries. This was done in order to get a feel for the sizes that we will be working with throughout the project. Primarily, we wanted to make sure that the core would be at a critical state during operation. This condition is determined by MCNP's $k$ coefficient calculation. If the value of the coefficient is greater than 1, then the core is supercritical. Exactly equal to 1 - the core is simply critical. Anything below 1 causes the reaction to halt since not enough particles are interacting for the fission to move forward.
