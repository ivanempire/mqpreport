\section{Monte Carlo}
\label{sec:mcarlo}

Monte-Carlo simulations rely on the method of random sampling, also known as "dart-throwing". The idea behind this is the fact that eventually, the results of the random samples will converge to the actual result. The more samples one takes, the more accurate the final result will be. A simple example to look at is a coin toss. The probability of getting a head or a tail is 50\%. However, if one tosses the coin 6 times, chances are the results will not be split evenly. One may get 5 heads and 1 tail, or 4 heads and 2 tails. However, tossing the coin 10 times, 100 times or even 10000 times - the results will become more evenly split with more trials\footnote{This approach is the basic concept behind probability distributions. The results are more accurate for any distribution as you increase the number of trials. The results will converge and sum up to 1.}.
